# MonthlyUtilityBillPrediction

Background: Have you noticed that your electricity bill has gone up this year? The wholesale
electricity prices in Australia are at record highs, tripling in the three months to June compared to
the same time last year. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) said it was because of
high commodity prices, coal-fired power outages and a cold east coast winter. As a major supplier
in the global energy market, Australia’s crisis is not due to a lack of supply. At the heart of this
issue are affordability concerns.
As shown in Fig. 1, the Sustainable Development Goal #71 is one of 17 Sustainable Development
Goals established by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. It aims to “ensure access to
affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.” Understanding the key factors (beyond
prices) that significantly affect electricity bills is regarded as one key step to promoting energy
efficiency and affordability.

Problem Setup and Task: A customer engagement team has conducted a survey asking
about household and resident information, such as how many people (and children) living in the
house/flat(apartment), how many rooms, whether there is an air conditioner (AC), the income of
the household and etc. This survey leads to a data set providing 10 predictors, which could be
used to understand how they affect the electricity bill.
Suppose you are a data analyst in a utility company. Your task is to develop a model with
appropriate feature engineering, which estimates the monthly electricity bill based on the given
possible predictors. In addition to accurate prediction of monthly electricity bill, it is essential
to provide inference generating insights into the relationship between the response variable (i.e.,
monthly electricity bill) and predictor variables (i.e., the predictors you choose to use in the model).
In other words, your developed model cannot be a black box.
